# Drug-Donation-Application

The requirement is to create a tool for Pharmacies in the Medical Units where people can come and Donate medicines and the needy ones can come with a doctor’s prescription and get the medicines which are available in the stock. The pharmacies will be the customer of the tool and the end user of the tool will be the receptionist of the pharmacies.
The tool should be able to display the medicines which will be donated by the Donors, as well as the donor details for the future reference. The tool should also provide an interface to add or delete donor and medicines which a donor donates.
